# Professional-Portfolio

## Description 
The motivation of creating this website was for work involving my html css and javascript skills be displayed as a website in order for future employers to view my experience and knowledge behind these skills. The reason behind building this project was to challenge me into building a website from scratch with no starter code. In order for me to meet the goal of completing a website on my own, involved me to organize effectively and have a plan of action. This website provides the solution of having a website where future projects that I complete will be showcased. I learned how to create a website that incorporates interactivness and responsivness by using the flex property and learning how sectioning and having a rough draft of a websites layout is vital for minimizing the roadblocks throughout the process of building a project.
